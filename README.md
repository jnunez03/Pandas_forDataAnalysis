# Python for Data Analysis: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ETC!
![Pandas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23710841/34076744-25597a40-e2be-11e7-9749-68dea8a29589.png)

## Getting Started
I recommend you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/). It is the best platform for using python as it comes pre-loaded with all the necessary libraries and it has IPython, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder IDE, and RStudio! It's amazing.

### File: pandas.py
This is time series data about people getting coffee from a machine.
Despite the file being about coffee, this is a very great way to see how pandas can be used and it gets very in-depth.

We need to see how things look for better understanding.

### Standard plots
File: standard.py

### Define Plot elements
File: define.py

### Formatting
File: format.py

### Labels 
File: labels.py

### Time Series
File: timeseries.py

### Histograms, boxes, scatters with some Seaborn!
File: HBS.py
![Seaborn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23710841/34332253-b96e9e92-e8fc-11e7-9c06-7cf5c067abc4.png)

# Math and Statistics

### Numpy 
File: numpy.py

### Summary Stats
File: Summary.py

Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance!

### Categorical Data
File: categorical.py

### Parametric Methods
File: parametric.py

Pearson Coefficient.

### Non-Parametric
File: nonpam.py

Spearmans rank and chi-squared tests.

### Transform Distributions   -- Scikit-learn --
File: distribution.py

You scale variables so that differences in magnitudes don't produce erroneous and misleading results. There are two ways to scale data.
One is normalization and the other is standardization. Normalization creates a value between 0 and 1 and standardization creates 0 mean and unit variance. 

# Dimensionality Reduction 
### Factor Analysis
File: factor.py

Used to find root causes that explain what causes data to act a certain way, for lack of a better expression. Factors are latent variables that are meaningful but are not directly observable. You regress on feautures in order to discover factors that you can use as variables to represent original data set. These are usually synthetic representations with extra dimensionality.

Factor Analysis assumes your features are continuous or ordinal. That you have correlation coefficient greater than .3, more than 100 observations present and more than 5 observations per features, which in minimial case is 20 features. Sample must also be homogenous.
### Principal Component Analysis
