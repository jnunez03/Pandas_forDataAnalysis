# Python for Data Analysis: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, ETC!
![Pandas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23710841/34076744-25597a40-e2be-11e7-9749-68dea8a29589.png)

## Getting Started
I recommend you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/). It is the best platform for using python as it comes pre-loaded with all the necessary libraries and it has IPython, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder IDE, and RStudio! It's amazing.

### File: pandas.py
This is time series data about people getting coffee from a machine.
Despite the file being about coffee, this is a very great way to see how pandas can be used and it gets very in-depth.

### Numpy 
File: numpy.py

### Summary Stats
File: Summary.py

Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance!

### Categorical Data
File: categorical.py

### Parametric Methods
