# Pandas for Analyzing data 

This repo is to show how to use pandas for anaylzing .csv files of whatever sort. 
In this case this was a file about people getting coffee from a machine and it includes the dates and times they got coffee.

Despite the file being about coffee, this is a very great way to see how pandas can be used and it gets very in-depth.
